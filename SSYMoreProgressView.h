 @brief    Subclass of UIProgressView which has additional features

/*!
 @brief    Whether or not the receiver is in a special "indeterminate" state
 wherein the progress value is not displayed, presumably because it is unknown
 
 @details  Setting to YES sets the receiver's `progress` property to 0.0,
 draws 5 equally-spaced and equal-sized "slugs", of the receiver's current
 progress tint color (usually blue) in the receiver's track, and begins
 animating these slugs in a continuous motion to the right.  Setting to NO
 stops the animation and removes the slugs.

/*!
 @brief    Factor by which to increase or decrease the thickness of the
 receiver's view (height if horizontal, width if vertical) from the value
 inherited from the base class UIProgressView (2.0 points in iOS 10.2).
 
 @details  Many people think that 2.0 points is too tiny to see, particularly
 on displays with the higher dot densities.
