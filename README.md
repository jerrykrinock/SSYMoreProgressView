SSYMoreProgressView
===================

SSYMoreProgressView is a Objective-C subclass of UIProgressView which adds these features:

* *Indeterminate* mode.  This is like the indeterminate mode of macOS' NSProgressIndicator.
* Adjustable thickness.  Too bad for you, Jonny Ives.  Now we can make our progress view as thick and *readable* as we want to :)
* Vertical orientation is available instead of just horizontal

The demo app is shown in [a quick video](https://youtu.be/N481iolOX-Q).

The additional features are requirements of using this class in [iupCocoaTouch](https://github.com/ewmailing/IupCocoaTouch), the iOS
port of [IUP](http://webserver2.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/), a multi-platformtoolkit for building graphical user interfaces.
